"""STRINGS AND ITS METHODS: 
strings in python can be denoted by using single quote ('  ') or double quote ("    ")
for example """

print('K-Hub')# --A string inside  single quote 
print("k-Hub")# --A string inside double quote

# Assigning string  to a  variable using single (' ') and double quote(" ")
string  ='K-Hub Task' # using single quote
print(f"-my string:{string}")

my_string ="K-Hub Task" #using double quote
print(f"-my string:{my_string} ")

# assign Multiline string to a variable by using triple single('''  ''') or double quotes(""" """)

#note from index 0 the string begins and also revese indexing also considered ,a single balnk space also considered as a character including special characters

#To find the length of a string by using a method -"len()"

#BOOLEAN
"""Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

Boolean Values
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False."""

#Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

#The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,

#OPERATORS -Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#There are 7 types of operators in python
"""Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators"""
